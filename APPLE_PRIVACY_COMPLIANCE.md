---

## 📋 Privacy Practices Implemented

### 1. **Explicit User Consent**
```typescript
// Age verification consent
const handleAgeConfirmed = () => {
  // User explicitly confirms 18+
  // Privacy notice displayed
  localStorage.setItem('ageConfirmed', 'true');
  localStorage.setItem('ageConfirmedDate', new Date().toISOString());
};

// Data collection consent
const handleConsentGiven = (permissions: ConsentPermissions) => {
  // Store user preferences
  // Only collect permitted data types
  // Respect user choices throughout app
};
```

### 2. **Clear Data Purpose**
Every data collection point includes:
- ✅ What data is collected
- ✅ Why it's needed
- ✅ How it's used
- ✅ Who can see it
- ✅ How to control/delete it

**Example**: Age Verification
```typescript
<PrivacyNote type="age">
  Your birthdate is never shown—only your age, quietly calculated.
</PrivacyNote>
```

### 3. **User Control & Rights**

#### Access Your Data
```typescript
// User can view all their data
GET /api/user/data-export
// Returns complete data package
```

#### Delete Your Data
```typescript
// Permanent account deletion
DELETE /api/user/account
// Removes all personal data within 30 days
```

#### Update Privacy Settings
```typescript
// Change data sharing preferences
PATCH /api/user/privacy-settings
{
  profileVisibility: 'private',
  showLocation: false,
  allowAnalytics: false,
  notifications: true
}
```

### 4. **Minimal Data Collection**
We follow the principle of data minimization:
- ❌ Don't collect: SSN, financial info, health data, contacts
- ✅ Only collect: What's needed for the dating service
- ✅ Optional: Enhanced features require opt-in

### 5. **Secure Data Handling**
```typescript
// Authentication
✅ Bcrypt password hashing
✅ JWT tokens with expiration
✅ HTTPS only (no plain HTTP)
✅ Row-level security (RLS)

// Storage
✅ Encrypted at rest (Supabase)
✅ Encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
✅ Secure API keys (environment variables)
✅ No logging of sensitive data
```

### 6. **Third-Party Data Sharing**
**Transparent disclosure**:

| Service | Data Shared | Purpose | User Consent |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| OpenAI | Profile text, quiz answers | AI matching | Automatic (anonymous) |
| Stripe | Payment info | Billing | Required for purchase |
| Email Provider | Email address | Transactional emails | Account creation |
| Apple/Google | Purchase data | App store billing | Platform requirement |

**NOT shared with**:
- ❌ Advertisers
- ❌ Data brokers
- ❌ Social media platforms
- ❌ Analytics companies (personal data)

## 🛡️ Privacy by Design

### 1. **Default Privacy Settings**
```typescript
const defaultPrivacySettings = {
  profileVisibility: 'matches-only',  // Not public by default
  showLastActive: false,              // Hidden by default
  showDistance: 'approximate',        // City-level, not precise
  shareLocation: false,               // Requires explicit opt-in
  analyticsConsent: false,            // Must opt-in
  marketingEmails: false              // Must opt-in
};
```

### 2. **Anonymous by Default**
- No real names required (can use first name only)
- Age shown, not birthdate
- Location: City-level, not GPS coordinates
- Matches see profile, not personal details

### 3. **User-Controlled Visibility**
```typescript
// Privacy levels
type ProfileVisibility = 
  | 'public'      // Anyone can see (user choice)
  | 'private'     // Matches only (default)
  | 'incognito'   // Hidden from searches (premium)
```
